# Crypto Clustering

## Overview
Analyze cryptocurrency market data using machine learning and data visualization techniques. Apply the K-means algorithm and principal component analysis (PCA) to classify cryptocurrencies according to their price fluctuations across various timeframes. Specifically, you will examine price changes over intervals spanning 24 hours, 7 days, 30 days, 60 days, 200 days, and 1 year.

## Data Preparation

*Standardize the data for better clustering results.
*KMeans Clustering: Grouping cryptocurrencies based on their market characteristics.
*Elbow Method: Determining the optimal value of k for KMeans clustering.
*PCA Analysis: Reducing dimensionality and re-clustering using PCA data.
*Visualization: Creating scatter plots for visual analysis of clusters.
